                        6353 * The video drivers provide a standard protocol for low-level comunication
                        6354 * with the 9918/28 VDP. There are four basic driver routines which between
                        6355 * them allow the programmer to write a value to a VDP register, read the
                        6356 * VDP status register, write a RAM or ROM buffer to a specified address
                        6357 * in VRAM, and read a RAM buffer from a specified address in VRAM.
                        6358 *
                        6359 * The four routines outlined above are:
                        6360 *
                        6361 *   Procedure RegWrite
                        6362 *
                        6363 *     Reg Write takes a VDP register number (0..7) in the B register
                        6364 *     and a byte value to be written to it in the C register. It writes
                        6365 *     the value to the given VDP register and returns.
                        6366 *
                        6367 *     If the specified register is one of the VDP mode control registers,
                        6368 *     ie. 0 or 1, then RegWrite  also writes the given value to the
                        6369 *     corresponding half of the VDP_ModeWord  in RAM. All mode dependant
                        6370 *     decisions made by the operating system are made by referencing the
                        6371 *     contents of this word. Thus it is important for the cartridge
                        6372 *     programmer to maintain it should he/she choose not to use
                        6373 *     RegWrite  in accessing the VDP registers.
                        6374 *
                        6375 *     In addition to the BC pair, Reg Write also makes use of AF.
                        6376 *
                        6377 *   Function RegRead
                        6378 *
                        6379 *     RegRead  reads the VDP status register and returns its contents
                        6380 *     in the A register.
                        6381 *
                        6382 *     It uses no other registers.
                        6383 *
                        6384 *     NOTE ****** While this routine has no side effects with respect to
                        6385 *                 the CPU, it should be used with caution since reads
                        6386 *                 to the status register have the effect of resetting the
                        6387 *                 VOP interrupt flag and may cause field interrupts to be
                        6388 *                 missed.
                        6389 *
                        6390 *   Procedure VramWrite
                        6391 *                                                                                                                                              ’
                        6392 *     Vram Write takes a pointer to the beginning of a data buffer in the
                        6393 *     HL pair, the VRAM destination address in the DE pair, and a byte
                        6394 *     count in the BC pair.
                        6395 *
                        6396 *     It writes the specified number of bytes from the buffer to VRAM
                        6397 *     starting at the destination address.
                        6398 *
                        6399 *     The AF,8C,DE, and HL register pairs are all affected.
                        6400 *
                        6401 *     NOTE ****** This procedure is not re-entrant.
                        6402 *
                        6403 *   Procedure Vram_Read
                        6404 *
                        6405 *     Vram Read takes a pointer to the beginning of a data buffer in the
                        6406 *     HL pair, the VRAM source address in the DE pair, and a byte count
                        6407 *     count in the BC pair.
