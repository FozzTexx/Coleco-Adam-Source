This is the Coleco Adam source code that was scanned by Kay Savetz and
is available at
https://archive.org/details/coleco-adam-technical-manual-eos6-os7

I wrote a special program to use tesseract to do the OCR and then
reformat its output taking into account that everything is printed
with a fixed width and all the characters should be aligned to a grid.

Eventually I'd like to be able to assemble the source, but it will
require a lot of manual labor to clean up the OCR.
