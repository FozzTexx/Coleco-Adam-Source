                           20       development on ADAM.   This listing provides the location
                         "24        of both released and unreleased entry points.  Released
                           22       entry points begin immediately in this file with the  jump
                           23       table and end before the first code segment listed.
                           24       Released entry points include the jump table, common  data
                           25       areas(EOSCOMN),  common data tables, and equates which
                           26       describe the released data structures.  Direct access
                           27       to code segments is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED and may make
                           28       your application incompatable with some ADAMs.  there  is
                           29       more than one version of EOS on the market at this  time
                                    and updates are planned.
