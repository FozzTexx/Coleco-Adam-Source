                      2166            Will read all the data, from both segments, for a given  controller
                      2167            All data  isreturned in regtsters          .
                      2168            Segment O data is returned the same as with 0S-7
                      2169
                      2170      NOTE - some operations are done in an odd order so that a certain
                      2171             number of cycles (T states) pass between port addressing.
                      2172             Turns off interupts if they were on at entry time for
                      2173             195 T states (approx. 54.5 micro secs), the iterupts
                      2174             are reenabled after this time if they were on before.
                      2175
                      2176      Callers  -  The input parameters are different than 0OS-7and
                      2177                  both segments are returned so only one call is  required
                      2178                  for all the data from a given controller.
                      2179                  The values returned are the same for segment O  (H, L,  E)
                      2180                  but segment 1 values are returned in B and OD.
